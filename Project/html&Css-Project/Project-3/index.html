        <h2>Section Two</h2>
        <p> Expect to feel excited but also nervous on your last day of college. Excitement about new opportunities and the road ahead, but nervous about what is to come and if you can make it (spoiler alert: of course you can!). 
            Expect to feel some bittersweet emotions — you may feel sad about ending an important chapter in your life, but also very happy and proud of the incredible accomplishments you’ve achieved by graduating college.

        <p> When the storm of the future comes to test our bond, the road seems rocky, and the distance threatens to tear us apart, 
            I am sure the memories we build together now will be strong enough to help us win over these challenges and keep our friendship strong forever.

        <p> Some moments are nice, some are bad. But don’t worry every moment of friendship is cherished whether its good or bad. 
            and No body is perfect. But when it comes to matter of friends, everyone becomes a perfect person with a perfect plan.
