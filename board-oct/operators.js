/*Operator	    Example	          Same As
=	             x = y	          x = y
+=	             x += y	          x = x + y
-=	             x -= y	          x = x - y
*=	             x *= y	          x = x * y
/=	             x /= y	          x = x / y
%=	             x %= y	          x = x % y
**=          	 x **= y	      x = x ** y*/
