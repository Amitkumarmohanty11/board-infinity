//When to use JavaScript const?
      /*  Always declare a variable with const when you know that the value should not be changed.

        Use const when you declare:

        A new Array
        A new Object
        A new Function
        A new RegExp

        */

//Example:-
       /* // You can create a constant array:
        const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
        
        // You can change an element:
        cars[0] = "Toyota";
        
        // You can add an element:
        cars.push("Audi");
